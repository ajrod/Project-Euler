Project-Euler
=============

I plan on using this repository to solve problems at [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/problems). I will
be posting details about how I solved each problem on the [wiki](https://github.com/ajrod/Project-Euler/wiki) 
for this repository. Many of the problems at
Project Euler are very difficult and are set up in such a way that brute forcing the answer will not run
in reasonable time. 

From the websites FAQ I gathered that every problem has been designed so that a solution
exists that runs in less than a minute. I will be using this restriction in considering if I have "solved"
a problem..

What is Project Euler?
------
From the home page of the website,

> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that 
> will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although 
> mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, 
> the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
