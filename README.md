Project-Euler
=============

I plan on using this repository to solve problems at at [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/problems). I will
be posting details about how I solved each problem on the wiki for this repository.

What is Project Euler?
------
From the home page of the website,

"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that 
will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although 
mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, 
the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems."
